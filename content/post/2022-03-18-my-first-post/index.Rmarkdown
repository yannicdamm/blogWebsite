# Creating Wedge and Windrose Buffers in R

For one of my research projects I wanted 

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

x = seq(-1, 1, .01)
y = sin(x^3)/(1 + x^6)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x, 
                     y = y)) +
geom_line() +
geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, 
                ymax = y), 
            fill = "pink", 
            alpha = 0.5) +
theme_void() 
```
